An experimental bot that posts a rundown of your musical week on Twitter.

## ðŸ¤” What does this do?
This clever bot does the following:
* Phones the last.fm API, exchanges pleasantries, asks how their cat is doing...
* Oh yeah, "can you tell me what <user> has listened to this week?"
* API kindly hands over the info (or gives us a whack of the handbag if we have no API key).
* We sneakily scrape the last.fm website for the artist pictures (better solutions welcome).
* We do some arts and crafts wizardary to formulate a collage picture.
* Lastly, the app phones up Twitter, asks how their leamur is hanging, and posts the info and picture.
